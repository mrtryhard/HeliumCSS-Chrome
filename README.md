# HeliumCSS-Chrome
Chrome Extension allowing to run [HeliumCSS](https://github.com/geuis/helium-css) within your browser.  
  
All bugs concerning results should be reported on the original helium-css repo. 
  
## Release version  
See the button over the code. The CRX is there. 
 
## Features
All good helium-css features packed within a Chrome extension.  
It allows to see unused CSS in your final css files. More details on HeliumCSS page.   
  
HeliumCSS is loaded at the end of the page loading. 


## Limitations
Well, Single Page Applications might have much difficulties making this work.    
If you use LESS/, it might be a bit harder to spot what's going on.   

## Usage
First click: inits helium-css.   
Second click: stops helium-css.  
  
Upon initialization, be patient. The script will navigate by itself through your pages. 

## Common errors
In some case, you will get random 404 pages. I figured you might have to enter full pages url. 

## Bug reports
